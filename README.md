# Arduino
##What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open source phisycal computing platform for creating interactive objects. The Arduino software and hardware are _open source_.
Arduino is inteded not just for programmers and engineers who have strong knowlege in software development and hardware functions, but also for artists, designers, students... who want to incorporate an interactive design inside their projects with Arduino physical computing capabilities.
The Arduino project was developed in an educational environment and is a very popular educational tool.

Arduino was born to teach **Interaction Design**, a design discipline that puts prototyping at the centre of its methodology.What is Interaction Design? A good definition is:
>Interaction Design is the design of any interactive experience.

The specific field of Interaction Design involved with Arduino is physical computing (or _Physical Interaction Design_).

**Physical computing** uses electronics to prototype new objects for designers and artists. It involves the design of interactive objects that can communicate with humans by using sensors and actuators controlled by a behaviour implemented as software running inside a microcontroller.

##The Arduino Way (or, as I learned, the beauty of Arduino)
The Arduino philosophy is based on making designs rather than talking about them. It is a constant search for faster and more powerful ways to build better prototypes. 

Classic engineering relies on a strict process for getting from A to B; the Arduino Way delights in the possibility of getting lost on the way and finding C instead.

Arduino is based on several principles:

* Prototyping

* Tinkering
>Tinkering is what happens when you try something you don’t quite know how to do, guided by whim, imagination, and curiosity. When you tinker, there are no instructions—but there are also no failures, no right or wrong ways of doing things. It’s about  guring out how things work and reworking them.
* Patching
* Circuit Bending: circuit benders excel in their ability to create the wildest devices by tinkering away with technology without necessarily understanding what they are doing on the theoretical side. 
* Keyboard Hacks: try to understand a little bit deeper how a object works to modify it and make it a little bit better.
* Hacking toys
* Collaboration: collaboration between users is one of the key principles in the Arduino world.
